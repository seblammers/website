  abstract = {Movements can inform us about what people are doing and also about how they feel. This phenomenologically evident distinction has been suggested to correspond functionally with differential neural correlates denoted as mirror neuron system (MNS) and mentalizing system (MENT). To separate out the roles of the underlying systems we presented identical stimuli under different task demands: character animations showing everyday activities (mopping, sweeping) performed in different moods (angry, happy). Thirty-two participants were undergoing functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) while asked to identify either the performed movement or the displayed mood. Univariate GLM analysis revealed the expected activation of either in MNS or MENT depending on the task. A complementary multivariate pattern-learning analysis based on the ``social brain atlas'' confirmed the expected recruitment of both systems. In conclusion, both approaches converge onto clearly distinct functional roles of both social neural networks in a novel dynamic social perception paradigm.},

  abstract = {Others' movements inform us about their current activities as well as their intentions and emotions. Research on the distinct mechanisms underlying action recognition and emotion inferences has been limited due to a lack of suitable comparative stimulus material. Problematic confounds can derive from low-level physical features, (e.g. luminance), as well as from higher-level psychological features (e.g. stimulus difficulty). Here we present a standardized stimulus dataset, which allows to address both action and emotion recognition with identical stimuli. The stimulus set consists of 792 computer animations with a neutral avatar based on full body motion capture protocols. Motion capture was performed on 22 human volunteers, instructed to perform six everyday activities (mopping, sweeping, painting with a roller, painting with a brush, wiping, sanding) in three different moods (angry, happy, sad). Five-second clips of each motion protocol were rendered into AVI-files using two virtual camera perspectives for each clip. In contrast to video stimuli, the computer animations allowed to standardize the physical appearance of the avatarand to control lighting and coloring conditions, thus reducing the stimulus variation to mere movement. To control for low level optical features of the stimuli, we developed and applied a set of MATLAB routines extracting basic physical features of the stimuli, including average background-foreground proportion and frame-by-frame pixel change dynamics. This information was used to identify outliers and to homogenize the stimuli across action and emotion categories. This led to a smaller stimulus subset (n = 83 animations within the 792 clip database) which only contained two different actions (mopping, sweeping) and two different moods (angry, happy). To further homogenize this stimulus subset with regard to psychological criteria we conducted an online observer study (N = 112 participants) to assess the recognition rates for actions and moods, which led to a final sub-selection of 32 clips (8 per category) within the database. The ACASS database and its subsets provide unique opportunities for research applications in social psychology, social neuroscience and applied clinical studies on communication disorders. All 792 AVI-files, selected subsets, MATLAB code, annotations and motion capture data (FBX-files) are available online.},

  abstract = {Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is an umbrella term for a range of conditions that share  core symptoms such as restricted interests, repetitive behaviors and deficits in social interaction  and communication. Motor impairments in ASD have been investigated mainly in children and  adolescents. Although the results are equivocal, some researchers proposed motor impairments to  be a core symptom of ASD. Research in adults with ASD remains scarce, but existing evidence  suggests that an age-related decrease in motor symptoms is likely. In addition, the level of  functioning may have an influence on motor skills. In the current project, motion capture  technology was used to quantify motor behavior of adults with and without high functioning ASD.  Participants were recorded (1) while performing neutral walking movements, and (2) while  performing mood-influenced everyday activities. The results show no significant differences in  walking movements between participants with or without ASD. In contrast, the results of the  mood-influenced movements show significant group differences. Together, these results suggest  that general motor skills in adults with high functioning ASD are not impaired, while the  production of nonverbal bodily cues is significantly different. These bodily cues carry information  (e.g. about mood) that are relevant for nonverbal communication. It has been shown that the  recognition of perceived movements increases when movements are more similar to the  movements of the perceiver. The current results thus show that the difficulties in nonverbal  communication between persons with and without ASD may stem from differences in movement  profiles.},
