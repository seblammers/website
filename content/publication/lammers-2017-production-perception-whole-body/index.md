abstract: 'The mirror neuron system (MNS) and the mentalizing system (MENT) are considered to be 
key elements of social cognition. The exact roles of the two systems are yet to be clarified. In a 
new approach to this question, we produced a set of video stimuli to be used in an upcoming 
functional magnetic resonance imaging study.  
We used a motion capture recording technique to map genuine human movements onto a 
virtual character. This yields the big advantage of being free from confounding variables such as 
age, gender, ethnicity or attractiveness. Furthermore the stimuli are highly controllable and can 
be manipulated for subsequent studies. The physical properties (e.g. luminance, movement 
speed) of the resulting video material were assessed with the help of an algorithm. This made it 
possible to exclude videos with outlier data in the mentioned physical properties. In a further step 
the remaining videos were rated by naïve volunteers to compute the recognition rates for each 
video, allowing us to filter out videos that were reliably rated correct. Thus, we generated a 
highly robust and homogenous set of video stimuli (validation study in preparation) to 
investigate the social brain (MNS, MENT).   
This thesis covers the production of the stimuli, the analysis of the movement characteristics 
and the rating of the videos through naïve volunteers. Additional analyses of correlations 
between the production (subjective experience and personal characteristics of volunteers during 
motion capture recordings) and the subsequent perception of these recordings were carried out. 
Results show no considerable correlation between personal characteristics (BIG5, empathy, 
emotional intelligence) and subsequent recognition rates. This can be interpreted as an indication 
that humans are able to recognize different moods from nonverbal behavior of others 
independently from the personality of the observed individual. However, we found significant 
correlations between the subjective immersion into a mood and the subsequent recognition rate. 
This means, the level of immersion into a mood has an impact on the subsequent recognizability 
when communicated nonverbally to other individuals.'
