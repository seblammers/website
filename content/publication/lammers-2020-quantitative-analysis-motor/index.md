abstract: Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is an umbrella term for a range of conditions
  that share  core symptoms such as restricted interests, repetitive behaviors and
  deficits in social interaction  and communication. Motor impairments in ASD have
  been investigated mainly in children and  adolescents. Although the results are
  equivocal, some researchers proposed motor impairments to  be a core symptom of
  ASD. Research in adults with ASD remains scarce, but existing evidence  suggests
  that an age-related decrease in motor symptoms is likely. In addition, the level
  of  functioning may have an influence on motor skills. In the current project, motion
  capture  technology was used to quantify motor behavior of adults with and without
  high functioning ASD.  Participants were recorded (1) while performing neutral walking
  movements, and (2) while  performing mood-influenced everyday activities. The results
  show no significant differences in  walking movements between participants with
  or without ASD. In contrast, the results of the  mood-influenced movements show
  significant group differences. Together, these results suggest  that general motor
  skills in adults with high functioning ASD are not impaired, while the  production
  of nonverbal bodily cues is significantly different. These bodily cues carry information  (e.g.
  about mood) that are relevant for nonverbal communication. It has been shown that
  the  recognition of perceived movements increases when movements are more similar
  to the  movements of the perceiver. The current results thus show that the difficulties
  in nonverbal  communication between persons with and without ASD may stem from differences
  in movement  profiles.
