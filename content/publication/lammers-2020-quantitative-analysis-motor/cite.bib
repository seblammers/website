 abstract = {Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is an umbrella term for a range of conditions that share  core symptoms such as restricted interests, repetitive behaviors and deficits in social interaction  and communication. Motor impairments in ASD have been investigated mainly in children and  adolescents. Although the results are equivocal, some researchers proposed motor impairments to  be a core symptom of ASD. Research in adults with ASD remains scarce, but existing evidence  suggests that an age-related decrease in motor symptoms is likely. In addition, the level of  functioning may have an influence on motor skills. In the current project, motion capture  technology was used to quantify motor behavior of adults with and without high functioning ASD.  Participants were recorded (1) while performing neutral walking movements, and (2) while  performing mood-influenced everyday activities. The results show no significant differences in  walking movements between participants with or without ASD. In contrast, the results of the  mood-influenced movements show significant group differences. Together, these results suggest  that general motor skills in adults with high functioning ASD are not impaired, while the  production of nonverbal bodily cues is significantly different. These bodily cues carry information  (e.g. about mood) that are relevant for nonverbal communication. It has been shown that the  recognition of perceived movements increases when movements are more similar to the  movements of the perceiver. The current results thus show that the difficulties in nonverbal  communication between persons with and without ASD may stem from differences in movement  profiles.},
