abstract: "Movements can inform us about what people are doing and also about how\
  \ they feel. This phenomenologically evident distinction has been suggested to correspond\
  \ functionally with differential neural correlates denoted as mirror neuron system\
  \ (MNS) and mentalizing system (MENT). To separate out the roles of the underlying\
  \ systems we presented identical stimuli under different task demands: character\
  \ animations showing everyday activities (mopping, sweeping) performed in different\
  \ moods (angry, happy). Thirty-two participants were undergoing functional magnetic\
  \ resonance imaging (fMRI) while asked to identify either the performed movement\
  \ or the displayed mood. Univariate GLM analysis revealed the expected activation\
  \ of either in MNS or MENT depending on the task. A complementary multivariate pattern-learning\
  \ analysis based on the ``social brain atlas'' confirmed the expected recruitment\
  \ of both systems. In conclusion, both approaches converge onto clearly distinct\
  \ functional roles of both social neural networks in a novel dynamic social perception\
  \ paradigm."
